# Project 1

## This project is a simple password generator. It asks the user to input a chosen number of charcters they want their password to be and generates a random string of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters for the number of characters the user specified.

### To run the script, start by going to the [homepage](https://github.com/uc-wilso6jm/it3038c-scripts) of my repository and downloading the ZIP folder.
### Once the ZIP folder is downloaded, navigate through the directories until you get to my project1.py file (it3038c-scripts-main > project1 > project1.py) and extract the .py file to your desktop.
### Open Powershell and cd to your Desktop directory
```powershell
cd C:\Users\<Name>\Desktop
```
### Now that you are in the correct directory that the .py file is located, you can just call the script to run by typing
```powershell
python project1.py
```
