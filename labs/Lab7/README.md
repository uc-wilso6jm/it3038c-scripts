# Lab 7

Here is a tutorial on how to use the Powershell module PSWordCloud. This module will take words and create a nice looking word cloud consisting on those words.

---
First, we need Powershell 7 to use this module. Start by going to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.1 and installing the Powershell 7.1.5 MSI package.

Once installed, start off by installing the PSWordCloud module
```powershell
Install-Module PSWordCloud
```
